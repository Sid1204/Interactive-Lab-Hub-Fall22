# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Setting: This interaction can be happening in a quiet room (for instance, an apartment). The room has a stage Actor in it. The Actor is preparing for a play, and is trying to practice their lines for the same. A small audience of one or a few could also be present in the room to help the Actor prepare.

Players: The Actor, and any practice audience members.

Activity: The actor is trying to practice their lines and is using iOto (the device) to help with the same. iOto speaks the lines of the other characters in the play, waits for the Actor to speak theirs when their part arrives, and so on. iOto uses a colored light to help the Actor pace themselves. When the Actor's part is coming up, the light changes to a shade of yellow (in place of the usual off-white), and finally to a deep green when it is the Actor's turn to deliver their lines.

Goals: To help the Actor rehearse their play and learn their lines in a more intuitive fashion.

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

Initial mockups of iOto had a screen to show expressions, but after some feedback, I chose to switch it out with a speaker grille that lights up. This was done to address two concerns: no one needs another screen, facial expressions wouldn't be the most helpful (body language would be, but that would be out of the scope for a small device).

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

Talking to a speaker might seem odd to some initially, but I would imagine that Actors who are used to rehearsals would not face that issue.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

The light would need to be bright so as to not require the Actor to look directly at iOto to be able to get the cues it is trying to provide. Reflections of a bright light bouncing off of the room's walls should help.

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
The ability to play specific audio cues directly without the need to randomly query the sound library to try and get a hit would be good. Besides that, it seems to work well! The setup and controls are pretty straightforward.

## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\* 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

![IMG-6998](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39087742/187325841-31387f8b-1a24-4a4d-b6c8-ab6c4e8ffbbc.jpg)

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

The prominence and brightness of the light, and the absence of a screen have been discussed above. Additionally, the device should also be water resistant so as to allow for shower rehearsals and promote usage in without the need to account for environment conditions. Having a singular light source instead of a screen also promotes simplicity and focus in design, which is something that I personally would appreciate in modern devices.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*
Link: https://youtu.be/PCaa2Ve6I5E

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
I was inspired by the motion picture "Drive My Car", and a character from the same also serves as the namesake for my device. Special shoutout to my partner for helping me sanity check certain features of iOto!


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
