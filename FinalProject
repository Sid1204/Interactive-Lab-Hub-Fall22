## Big Idea

An automated garden maintenance system that looks after shared community gardens by:
- tracking environmental indicators and 
- providing personalized, remote care for plants


Main features: 
1) Temperature, sunlight, humidity, soil moisture content monitoring 
2) 2) remote regulation based on monitored indicators (sprinklers, etc.)


## Timeline

11/21-22: test all sensors in real environment
11/29: present prototyped device
12/6: costumed device + demo presentation
12/16: final reporting 
 
## Parts Needed

- Soil moisture sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Rain sensor, etc.


## Risks

- Wifi connections in community gardens
- Diverse-background of users that are connected to this system
- Weather conditions â†’ plan to costume!
- Diverse plant care needs 

## Fallback Plan

Reduce number of sensors and/or scale back scope. We do not anticipate a lot of difficulty integrating most sensors as we've worked with many of them before.
